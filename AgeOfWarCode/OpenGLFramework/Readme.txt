This is the newest NeHeGL basecode in a Visual Studio.net solution, with some modifications.

-there is an appTitle variable in the main file so you can easily define the title that appears for the program when in windowed mode
-there is a screenInfo array for easy access to the width, height and bits per pixel settings for the program

-there is a separate file for handling the key presses, for ease of location.
